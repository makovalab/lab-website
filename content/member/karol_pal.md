Karol has a Computer Science background but also enjoys the biological aspect of his work. He did his PhD in Oncology analyzing clonal evolution in leukemias. Currently he is focusing on a more standard type of evolution, that of the primate sex chromosomes. He enjoys creating interactive visual representations of his findings. Outside of the lab Karol likes playing music and scuba diving.
