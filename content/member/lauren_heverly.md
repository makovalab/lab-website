Lauren is broadly interested in studying the mechanisms and genetic markers of human disease. She is currently working on a project investigating non-canonical DNA structures, specifically, examining the conditions of G-quadraplex formation. She plans to pursue a Ph.D. in the Biomedical Sciences field after completing her undergraduate education.
