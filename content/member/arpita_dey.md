Arpita has a background in studying the molecular biophysical interactions of G-quadruplex and other quadruplex DNA structures involved in anticancer mechanisms. With a strong interest in cancer biology, she is now exploring the molecular evolutionary medicine of non-B-DNA structures in primates, focusing on G-quadruplexes (G4). Her current work includes analyzing BG4 antibody ChIP-sequencing data and investigating the molecular interactions of G4 with ligands to understand their functional roles and potential therapeutic significance. Outside the lab, Arpita enjoys singing, cooking, and traveling to explore new places.
