Jacob's current research in Makova Lab uses a combination of experimental and computational approaches to characterize the role of non-canonical DNA secondary structures in primate genomes. Before joining Makova Lab, Jacob studied RNA biochemistry. His Ph.D. thesis work with Dr. Philip Bevilacqua updated thermodynamic models that describe RNA secondary structures to better reflect the cellular environment. His undergraduate thesis work focused on drug targeting RNA thermometers in bacteria.
