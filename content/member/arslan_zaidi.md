I am interested in studying both the proximal (developmental) and
ultimate (evolutionary) causes of human genetic variation.  I am
currently examining the transmission of mitochondrial heteroplasmies
in families to understand the biological processes governing
mitochondrial DNA inheritance in humans.  When I’m not science-ing,
I’m drawing or re-reading The Lord of the Rings.
