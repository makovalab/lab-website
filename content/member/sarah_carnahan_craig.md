Sarah is interested in human evolution with a specific emphasis
on genetic variation within and between species, gene duplication,
and the evolution of regulatory elements. She found that the application
of knowledge from these genetic investigations to explain (or help
explain) phenotypic observations in humans (especially related to
reproduction and human health) to be particularly exciting. Her
project in the Makova Lab was focused on childhood obesity.
