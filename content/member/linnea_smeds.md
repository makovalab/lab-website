Linnéa's research in the Makova lab involves investigating selection in non-canonical DNA from primates, especially  G4 quadruplexes,  using bioinformatics methods. Linnéa worked for 8 years as a bioinformatician in Dr. Hans Ellegren's lab, developing approaches to study speciation, mutation rate and sex chromosome evolution in birds, before taking on a Ph. D. in evolutionary genetics. Her thesis "Conservation genomics in inbred Scandinavian wolves using bioinformatic methods" involved work on Y chromosome evolution, admixture, genetic load and structural variation.
