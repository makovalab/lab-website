From the very beginning of my studies, I have been trying to
understand the evolution of sex chromosomes across invertebrate and
vertebrate taxa.  Now, my postdoctoral research is focused on the
Y chromosomes of primates.  Using comparative genomics tools I am
trying to answer important questions linked to the male heterogamety
of our closest relatives.
