I am a PhD student in the Bioinformatics and Genomics Program
co-advised by Dr. Kateryna Makova and Dr. Yi-Fei Huang.  Currently
I am studying the evolution of human genome, specifically
G-quadruplexes and regulatory elements.  By
integrating machine learning and phylogenetic inferences, I aim to
explore the connection between evolutionary biology and human health.
