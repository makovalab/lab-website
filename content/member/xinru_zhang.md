Xinru is a Ph.D. student in the Bioinformatics and Genomics Program co-advised by Dr. Kateryna Makova and Dr. Yi-Fei Huang. Currently, she is studying the evolution of human genome, specifically G-quadruplexes and regulatory elements. By integrating machine learning and phylogenetic inferences, she aims to explore the connection between evolutionary biology and human health.
