Before joining Makova Lab, Hana worked for six years in the field of molecular genetic characterization of pediatric solid tumors and hereditary diseases in Prof. Slabyâ€™s research group at CEITEC, Masaryk University, Brno, Czechia. She got familiar with the interpretation of next generation sequencing data (mainly WES, RNA seq) and a spectrum of molecular genetic methods. She collaborated on several publications and grant projects. In Makova Lab she is responsible for cell cultivation, performing molecular biology methods, and has recently started a new project focusing on the study of telomeres in macaques. Apart from work, she enjoys spending time with her husband and 3 year-old son.
