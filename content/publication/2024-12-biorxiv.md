abstract = "Mitochondria, cellular powerhouses, harbor DNA (mtDNA) inherited from the mothers. MtDNA mutations can cause diseases, yet whether they increase with age in human germline cells-oocytes-remains understudied. Here, using highly accurate duplex sequencing of full-length mtDNA, we detected de novo mutations in single oocytes, blood, and saliva in women between 20 and 42 years of age. We found that, with age, mutations increased in blood and saliva but not in oocytes. In oocytes, mutations with high allele frequencies (â‰¥1%) were less prevalent in coding than non-coding regions, whereas mutations with low allele frequencies (<1%) were more uniformly distributed along mtDNA, suggesting frequency-dependent purifying selection. In somatic tissues, mutations caused elevated amino acid changes in protein-coding regions, suggesting positive or destructive selection. Thus, mtDNA in human oocytes is protected against accumulation of mutations having functional consequences and with aging. These findings are particularly timely as humans tend to reproduce later in life."
