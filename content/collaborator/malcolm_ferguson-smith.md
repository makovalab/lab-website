Malcolm Ferguson-Smith's significant contributions to human genetics and cytogenetics range from early studies applying the sex chromatin method to the analysis and frequency of intersexual states, and to genome mapping using chromosome rearrangements. Malcolm was the first to report the now familiar phenomenon of satellite association, the 48 XXXY karyotype, the specificity of location of secondary constrictions in the human chromosome set and gene location by in situ hybridization.
