Prof. Eichler's research is focused on understanding the evolution, pathology and mechanism(s) of recent gene duplication and DNA transposition within the human genome. His work involves the systematic discovery of these regions, the development of methods to assess their variation, the detection of signatures of rapid gene evolution and ultimately the correlation of this genetic variation with phenotypic differences within and between species.
