Francisco's research focuses on understanding the molecular and functional interactions between oocytes and granulosa cells that promote production of a fertile oocyte. This knowledge can then be used to (1) develop better therapeutic interventions for infertility or species preservation and (2) develop better reproductive management tools for animal agriculture.
