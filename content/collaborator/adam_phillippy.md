Dr. Adam Phillippy is a Senior Investigator and head of the Genome Informatics Section at the National Human Genome Research Institute. His lab develops and applies computational methods for the analysis of massive genomics datasets, focusing on the challenges of genome sequencing and comparative genomics. He is a pioneer of single-molecule sequencing for the reconstruction of complete genomes and is best known for his work on completing the human genome from “telomere to telomere”.
